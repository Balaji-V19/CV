                <p class="myprj">This is one of the E-commerce applications where we can buy grocery products and
                    vegetables. In this app, we can add money to our wallets using Razorpay. This application is more
                    like creating subscriptions for a particular product. In this application, we will be having
                    different categories of products and we can select any products to subscribe but it is deliverable
                    only for certain areas, not every place. For example only in Chennai. This application is available
                    in both the play store and AppStore.

                <p class="myprj">This application is used for getting updates about covid19. In this application, we can
                    get the covid19 cases state-wise and district-wise as well. we can apply for an e-pass using this
                    application and also we can have a discussion with the doctors using this application. Here we can
                    get the details about covid symptoms and how they are spreading and all kinds of stuff. I've used
                    firebase to store data and for Authenticate I've used Firebase auth. We can also have a look at how
                    to take precautionary steps for covid19.

                <h4>Covid snap</h4>
                <p class="myprj">This application is one of the alternatives for both google meet and google classroom.
                    In this covid pandemic, most of the students have to use both google classroom and google meet for
                    attending class. So like google classroom Staff can upload their notes and also they can upload
                    assessments for all the students. Here we can have a chat with our staff if we have any doubts. We
                    can make video or audio calls with the students in that group using this application.

                <h4>Cyber widget</h4>
                <p class="myprj">This application is more like a LinkedIn where we can show our work to other people and
                    have a chat with others for hire or get hired but this application is only for Flutter developers.
                    Only the flutter developers can upload their projects.
                    We've built this application for the International Flutter hackathon and we came in top 80th in that
                    competition. In this project, I've worked with 4 other people who are from 3 different countries
                    like Dubai, Europe, and India. It was a virtual hackathon.

                <h4>Onmipolis</h4>
                <p class="myprj">This application is built for women's safety. I'm one of the developers of this
                    project. We have built this application for women, So whenever they feel threatened or unsafe they
                    can just press one button and their location will be sent to their parents or their friends. We have
                    used Google maps API and a lot of other native features to build this application. So this
                    application is not only for women's whenever we face some accident or fire accident or any incidents
                    we can use this application to let others know about this incident.

                <h4>Edusaint</h4>
                <p class="myprj">Edusaint is one of the chatting applications that I built when I was started learning
                    flutter. I've created that app design, backend, and frontend. In this application, we can search for
                    the user, and then we can send the following request. If the other person accepts your request you
                    can have a chat with them. Here we have one cool feature we can have a chat with some random people
                    by using the random chat screen. So when the user taps on the random chat button this application
                    will check for the active user and make those users connect as temporary friends but both user's
                    identities won't be revealed.
